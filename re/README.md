# Reverse engineering materials
Resources for teaching reverse engineering.

## Demos
The following code is included in this directory to help teach reverse engineering:

- `helloworld`: implementations of "hello, world" in C, C++, and Rust.
- `xorware`: a program that reads in a list of files and XORs them with a fixed byte.

## Tools
Our workshops generally use one or more of the following tools:

- [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/): the NSA's reverse engineering toolkit.
- [radare2](https://www.radare.org/r/): an open-source framework for binary reverse engineering and analysis. Includes a decompiler, scripting in multiple languages, forensics tools, etc.
  - The radare book: [https://www.radare.org/get/radare.pdf](https://www.radare.org/get/radare.pdf)
  - [Cutter](https://cutter.re/): a frontend for radare2. Since v9.0.0 it also comes with the Ghidra decompiler built-in.

## Additional

- [Practical Binary Analysis](https://nostarch.com/binaryanalysis): a more advanced binary reverse engineering book from No Starch.
  - Includes a VM with various binary analysis exercises.
